# stock_prediction
This is a Machine Learning Model, I created as a hobby since it is in Python and i am fetching data from yfinance and it will predict the price for the Ticker/Company Mentioned in the List.
This Model is just for a Fun i did, i donot have a knowledge about Machine Learning Exculsively but i like to Learn New things.
